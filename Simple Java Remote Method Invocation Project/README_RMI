Steps for Implementing RMI :

1. Create a folder with any name..

2. In that folder, create two folders with any name, i.e, one for client and one for server..

3. In the server folder, create three java files, i.e, one for server, one for remote interface and one for the implementation of remote interface..

4. In the client folder, create a client java file..

5. Now write the code for all the java files...

6. Open command prompt from client folder and server folder..

7. Type " javac *.java " in the command prompt (opened from both client and server folder) to compile all the java files present..

8. In the command prompt (server), type " rmic (name of the java file which contains the implementation of the remote interface) ". 
This will generate a stub file. Now copy the .class file of remote interface and stub file and paste those two files in the client folder...

Then, type " start rmiregistry (any port number mentioned) " or " start rmiregistry " as I have already mentioned the port number. 
This command without giving portnumber may work, check this out by yourself...      


Type " start java (name of server java file) (any same port number) "or " start java (name of server java file) " as port number mentioned..

Note - You can give any kind of any port number but it should be same in both the client and server site program..

I have mentioned this portion rmi://localhost:1020/add :

Here add - name of rmi client through which the server will find it when it will try to connect remotely. You can give any name for the rmi client but remember server should find it with the same name.. otherwise the rmi won't work..

localhost - since same machine is used for rmi so i kept ip address as localhost. You can keep ip address to use rmi to connect different machines remotely.  

9. In the command prompt (client), type " java ( name of the java client file) ". and it's Done..
